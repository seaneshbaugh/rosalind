# Rosalind

Solutions to [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) problems in x86-64 assembly.

# Building

Just run `make`.

## Running

Currently the path to the input files is hardcoded. Run each executable from the project root directory like this: `build/base-count`. This will ensure the files in the data directory are found.

## Notes

I've only done this on OSX. All IO is done through calls to standard C functions.
